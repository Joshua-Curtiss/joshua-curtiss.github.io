about:
    title: "Biography"
    text: "I am currently a postdoctoral associate in the psychiatry department at Harvard Medical School / Massachusetts General Hospital. My research interests pertain to leveraging state-of-the-art statistical approaches to address questions relating to the nosology and treatment of emotional disorders. Specifically, my research embraces statistical procedures that foster idiographic and precision medicine approaches to clinical psychology, such as intensive time-series research designs and machine learning approaches. These activities are complemented by my interests in philosophy of science. I received my PhD in clinical psychology from Boston University under the mentorship of Dr. Stefan Hofmann, and I completed my pre-doctoral internship in the CBT track at MGH/Harvard Medical School. Prior to pursuing my doctoral degree, I was a statistician and researcher in the clinical psychology department at Yale University for several years. I received my undergraduate degrees from Rutgers University in cognitive science, philosophy, and psychology."

      - title: "Nosology of Emotional Disorders"
        desc: "Most of my research investigates alternative classification frameworks for emotional disorders. Recent interests include the application of complex causal network approaches and critical transition methods in the cross-sectional and longitudinal modeling of emotional disorders."

      - title: "Philosophy of Science and Psychopathology"
        desc: "My scientific research is complemented by my abiding passion for metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of science. I primarily endorse and defend global skepticism. A current paper that will be under review explores the ontology of mental disorders, contenting that an anti-realist framework offers the best explanatory account."
        icon: fas fa-mortar-pestle
      - title: "Emotion Regulation and Mindfulness"
        desc: "Another principal domain of inquiry is how deficits in emotion regulation and mindfulness relate to the maintenance of anxiety and depressive disorders. Recent papers have investigated the presence of differential mindfulness deficits across generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. Furthermore, I am interested in emotion regulation mechanisms underlying empirically supported treatments."

      - title: "Statistics"
        desc: "Recent interests include the potential application of finite mixture models and complex causal network approaches to characterize emotional psychopathology. Moreover, I have also become interested in longitudinal methods of addressing mediation (e.g., extensions of latent growth modeling techniques, dampened oscillator models, etc.)."
