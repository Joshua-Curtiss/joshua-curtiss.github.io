              {{"I am currently an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University in the Institute for Cognitive and Brain Health. My primary appointment is in the Department of Applied Psychology, with an affiliation in the Department of Psychology. I am also a Research Associate in the Psychiatry Department of Massachusetts General Hospital with the Depression Clinical and Research Program. I currently direct the Computational Clinical Psychology Lab at Northeastern University. My research interests pertain to computational clinical psychology, leveraging state-of-the-art statistical approaches to address questions relating to the nosology and treatment of emotional disorders. Specifically, my research embraces statistical procedures that foster idiographic and precision medicine approaches to clinical psychology, such as intensive time-series research designs and machine learning approaches. My approach emphasizes computational strategies that capture the dynamic complexity of emotional disorders (e.g., network science, dynamical systems, time-series forecasting, etc.) to promote more personalized and tailored interventions. In additional to the computational focus of my work, I also maintain active lines of research in affective science (i.e., delineating maladaptive emotion regulation components underlying anxiety and depression), mindfulness approaches to mental health, and elucidating mechanisms of empirically-supported treatments (e.g., CBT, mindfulness, etc.). These activities are complemented by my interests in philosophy of science. I completed my postdoctoral fellowship in the Psychiatry Department at Harvard Medical School / Massachusetts General Hospital. I received my Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from Boston University under the mentorship of Dr. Stefan Hofmann, and I completed my pre-doctoral internship in the CBT track at MGH/Harvard Medical School. Prior to pursuing my doctoral degree, I was a statistician and researcher in the clinical Psychology Department at Yale University for several years. I received my undergraduate degrees from Rutgers University in cognitive science, philosophy, and psychology." | markdownify }}
